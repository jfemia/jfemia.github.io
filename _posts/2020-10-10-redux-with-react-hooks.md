What is Redux and why do you care?

> The short answer: It lets you define a regular javascript object that you use to store some global state so you can access it from any part of your app. That's effectively it, the rest is bells and whistles.

Before we start, if you learn better by seeing the whole thing working, the sample app code we build in this tutorial is [available here.](https://github.com/jfemia/react-redux-hooks-example-app).

***

If you're reading this you probably heard about this Redux thing. Maybe you also heard about *reducers* and thought *"huh..."* - I certainly did. It took me a few passes over bits of Redux code before it fully clicked. Maybe I can save you some time.

But, rather than throw out-of-context explainations about Redux terminology at you, I'll introduce relevant concepts as we encounter them in a simple implementation. This is my fairly opinionated flavour of a Redux-based app. There are many pages of documentation and tutorials out there, all of them present their own conventions for structuring Redux code, and not many of them that I've encountered seem to make use of React Hooks.

So after some trial and error on my part I've found what works for me - clear and concise, hopefully.

# Get on with it

For this tutorial let's create a boilerplate React app called `react-redux-hooks` so we have something to work with:
```
npx create-react-app react-redux-hooks
```

We'll be building one of the most overused apps in tutorials, a "todo" app.

Firstly we need `redux` and `react-redux` packages
```
yarn add redux react-redux
```
(or, if you use npm)
```
npm i --save redux react-redux
```

# Reducers
While writing this tutorial I originally started by explaining the **Store** first, but I found that I couldn't give a satisfactory summary without the background information about what is reducer actually is.

Just like many things on the internet, there are many explainations of what a Redux reducer is, why it's called a reducer, and so on. If you're so inclined, i'll leave [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40599496/why-is-a-redux-reducer-called-a-reducer) here for you to read through at your leisure. For now I'll give you a short answer.

## What is a Reducer, then?
A reducer is simply a function that recieves two arguments: your state object, and some *action* to identify what it should do with the state. It returns a new state object to take the place of the one that was passed in.

Remember when I mentioned the regular javascript object that you use to store some global state? Well, that is the "state" object that a reducer function receives. We do this because our global state object is considered immutable - that is, we shouldn't change fields in it directly. A reducer is responsible for making state changes in a structured way. If we were just going to change fields directly on a global object, we wouldn't use Redux.

## Todo Reducer
Just to make clear what I mean, here is our empty reducer function for handling our todo list.

Let's go into the `src` folder of the React app we just made, and create `store/todo.js`. These are the lines we need:
```js
const initialState = [];

export default function(state = initialState, action) {
  return state;
}
```
Let's break this down.

The default export from this file is the reducer function. We can see it takes two arguments, and it returns some state. Right now it does not return a *new* state object, because it is not doing anything with the `action` argument and so can just pass the original state back, unmodified.

Notice that it also has a default value for the `state`, which is just an empty array - we don't have any items in our todo list yet. We do this to allow Redux to initialize the **Store**.


# Store
The central Redux concept, as it were. As we saw above, our reducer will be handling changes to our state, but we still need to create the "global state object". We do this by giving our reducer to Redux and instructing it to create this object for us. Don't worry, it should make sense in a minute.

Let's add another file - `src/store/index.js`:
```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';
import todo from './todo';

const reducers = { todo };

export default createStore(combineReducers(reducers));
```

As you can see this bit of plumbing does a few things.

The main bit of business is the `createStore` function call, which takes a single reducer and optionally some initial state to populate. This is the call that effectively returns us our global state object.

We create a `reducers` object with our todo reducer and use `combineReducers`, which is how you add multiple reducers. This is a bit of my personal preference, but my reasons are:
- Reducers can logically group distinct sections of the global state - we have todos now, maybe we also want to manage authentication or something, later.
- I don't think I've ever built a real app using Redux that didn't end up defining more than one reducer.
- Even if there's just one now, we don't have to change this code later, other than adding to the `reducers` object.

Right now, our call to `createStore` as written results in a javascript object that looks like this:
```js
{
  todo: []
}
```
When we called `createStore` with our reducer, it called our reducer with `undefined` as the state, and our default value - the empty array - was returned and put into the state.

# React plumbing
Before we go further with Redux, there's a couple of other bits of setup we need to do to connect React to our Redux state. Doing this now should help avoid distractions when we get to the next section.

In order to link the Redux store with our React app, the `react-redux` package gives us a `Provider` component, that we need to use to wrap the entire application so our store is available to our components.

We do this in `src/index.js`, which already exists, by adding some imports and the `Provider` component:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'; // add this import
import store from './store';            // and this one
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

// Wrap the <App /> line with a Provider using our store
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// ... snip
```
> Note: you will see `//... snip` in several code blocks, this is just where I omitted some existing code from the example - it should remain untouched in your files.

This is enough for any of our components rendered by our app to be able to get data out of the state. Let's modify `src/App.js` to show how:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'; //add this import
import './App.css';

function App() {
  // Define a variable to access our todo list
  const todos = useSelector(state => state.todo);

  // ...snip
}
```

Here we are using another function from `react-redux` - `useSelector`. This is a hook to connect to a specific piece of Redux state. Connecting in this way means that React will re-render if the specified part of the state changes, similar to `props`, or `useState`.

Our `todos` variable now contains an array from the state - we can quickly update our `App.js` return value to include it (and to clear out some of the default React text). We aren't aiming to be UI wizards here, any display will work...
```jsx
return (
  <div className="App">
    <header className="App-header">
      <ul>
        {todos.map((t,i) => <li key={i}>{t.title}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </header>
  </div>
);
```

If we refresh the page, we can't see anything but the React-blue background. This is to be expected, we haven't added any todos yet. 

Also, what is `t.title`? We didn't actually define any structure for our todo items yet, but for this example app we'll just be using a title and a status.

So how do we add todos? We need to introduce the next Redux concept, **Actions**, and then define one for adding todos.

# Actions

Now that we have an action to add a todo, we need a way of triggering it. Let's quickly add a text input and Add button to the page

The button needs to take the text input value and dispatch the add action. To do this we use the other react-redux hook - useDispatch, to get a dispatch function.

Now our button callback can dispatch the new todo, and we see the list being populated.


So that's the basics, but what else can we do with this?

We said we wanted to be able to set items to "done", and it would also be useful to be able to delete todo items.

Usually this type of data management (input, update, delete) would be driven by some kind of persistent data storage. We won't worry about that just yet, however we do need to treat the data similarly - namely we need to generate IDs to identify our todo items.
Without this, we will struggle to update items as we only have the name to work with, and this might now be unique.

We can simply update our reducer, so that when it adds a new todo, it also generates an id for it. Since this is an example, we'll just use a running counter from 1.

We can also update our list display to use the actual todo keys instead of the array index.

Now let's add a couple more actions for updating status, and deleting, using the ID to find the item to update.

Now that we have more than one possible action in our reducer, it becomes more readable to use a switch statement

Let's add a bit more UI to make use of these new actions

There we go, some rough buttons to set a todo as "done", or delete one.
