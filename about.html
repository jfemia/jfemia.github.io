    <p>Hi, I'm Jamie.</p>

    <p>Professionally, I'm a software engineer turned engineering manager. That means I used to write code but write a little less now, and spend more time finding ways to help others be effective and grow personally and professionally.</p>

<p>Outside of work I still enjoy building software, mostly as hobby projects. I'd consider myself a weird kind of creative person - not artistic in the traditional sense but I like putting components together to build something - whether that's software, good food, or wooden structures.</p>

<p>On this site I mostly intend to write about software - inspired heavily by things I am exposed to either during work or hobby.</p>
